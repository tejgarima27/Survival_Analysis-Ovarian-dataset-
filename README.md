# Survival_Analysis-Ovarian-dataset

### Survival Analysis is analyzing data with time change.We try to understand the estimate of occurence of particular event with length of time.The survival analysis helps in the predicting the occurence of the event next time.That is analyzing the duration of time for particular state.There are three core components for analyzing survival analysis with statistical methods. The Survival Analysis is different from churn analysis as it takes into account the concept of “Censoring”.The Censoring is defined as the observations that is incomplete data which is assumed to be non-informative. Censoring is never caused by the “event” defining endpoints of experiment.The observations that are censored do not mean that the event for that observation occured like patient who is censored do not mean that they died. We are making use of Ovaries dataset for Survival Analysis.


### The Ovarian dataset comprises of a cohort of ovarian cancer patients and respective clinical information, including the time patients were tracked until they either died or were lost to follow-up (futime), whether patients were censored or not (fustat), patient age, treatment group assignment, presence of residual disease and performance status.

### WE ARE ESTIMATING SURVIVAL FUNCTION USING KAPLAN-MEIER ESTIMATE AND THEN COX-HAZARD MODEL.
